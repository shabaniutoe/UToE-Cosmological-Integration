# UToE – Cosmological Integration

This repository contains a structural analysis of bounded integration dynamics
in large-scale cosmology.

The goal of this work is to evaluate whether selected cosmological integration
measures exhibit constrained, monotonic saturation behavior under known physical
regimes, without modifying or challenging standard cosmological models.

## Scope

This repository examines:

- Integrated structure formation across cosmic time
- Saturation under dark-energy–dominated expansion
- Boundary conditions where bounded integration fails (e.g. inflation)
- Structural compatibility testing, not physical causation

This work does **not** propose new cosmological laws or parameters.

## Paper

The full manuscript will be provided as:

- `paper.md` — academic paper (Markdown)
- Archived version hosted on OSF

---

## Reproducibility

Planned materials:

- Observational references (ΛCDM-consistent)
- Structural integration definitions
- No simulation code at this stage (theoretical scope)

---

## Relationship to Other Domains

This repository is part of a multi-domain structural research program:

- **Neural dynamics** — adversarially tested
- **Genetic systems** — structurally constrained
- **Cosmological systems** — this repository

Each domain is analyzed independently to avoid overreach.
