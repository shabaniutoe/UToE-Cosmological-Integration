# Structural Model Comparison Framework

This document specifies how bounded logistic integration is compared
against alternative growth models for cosmological integration measures.

The logistic-style model is:

> dΦ/dt = r · λ · γ · Φ · (1 − Φ / Φ_max)

which yields a bounded, sigmoidal Φ(t) for constant r, λ, γ.

The comparison is structural and conceptual. No new cosmological dynamics
are introduced.

## 1. Reference Growth Models

For a chosen Φ(t), three reference growth families are considered:

1. **Linear growth**

   > Φ(t) = a · t + b

   Unbounded, constant-rate accumulation. Appropriate when integration
   proceeds at roughly constant speed over the time interval.

2. **Power-law or unbounded nonlinear growth**

   > Φ(t) = A · t^α

   with α > 0. Captures scale-free, unbounded growth without saturation.

3. **Bounded logistic growth**

   Φ(t) generated by the logistic equation above, with 0 ≤ Φ ≤ Φ_max.

These forms are used as **structural templates**, not as fitted curves
in this repository.

## 2. Structural Criteria

A Φ(t) measure is treated as structurally compatible with logistic
behavior when:

- Φ(t) is monotonic over the time range studied,
- Φ(t) approaches an identifiable upper bound Φ_max,
- dΦ/dt decreases as Φ approaches Φ_max,
- a linear or simple power-law description fails to capture this
  saturation in a natural way.

When Φ(t) is:

- oscillatory,
- non-monotonic,
- or clearly unbounded over the relevant time interval,

logistic-style bounded integration is considered structurally
inappropriate.

## 3. Interpretation of λ and γ

In this comparison framework:

- **λ** summarizes background drivers (expansion rate, matter content,
  dark-energy fraction) that set the overall tendency for structure
  growth.
- **γ** summarizes internal coherence (clustering efficiency,
  feedback-regulated growth, environment-dependent effects).

No attempt is made to estimate λ or γ numerically in this repository.
Instead, they serve as conceptual placeholders indicating that:

- external and internal factors combine multiplicatively in the growth
  rate of Φ(t),
- the curvature scalar K = λ · γ · Φ can be used, in principle, as a
  structural indicator of how close the system is to saturation.

## 4. Outcome of the Comparison

The objective is to classify cosmological integration measures into:

- **Logistic-compatible regimes**  
  where bounded, saturating Φ(t) is structurally plausible,

- **Non-logistic regimes**  
  where linear, power-law, or oscillatory models are more appropriate,

- **Ambiguous regimes**  
  where available information is insufficient to favor any structural
  template.

This classification constrains the domain of applicability of
logistic-style bounded integration within cosmology and avoids any claim
of universality.
