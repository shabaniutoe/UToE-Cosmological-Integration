# Data Sources

This repository does not host raw cosmological datasets.

All structural analyses are intended to be performed using summary
statistics and results from **publicly available** cosmological surveys
and simulations, such as:

- Cosmic microwave background measurements (e.g., Planck),
- Large-scale structure and galaxy surveys,
- N-body and hydrodynamical simulations under ΛCDM and related models,
- Published halo mass function and correlation-function studies.

Users who wish to implement numerical analyses should:

1. Obtain the relevant datasets directly from the original surveys or
   simulation projects, following their licensing and citation
   requirements.
2. Document dataset provenance, preprocessing, and any normalization
   used to construct Φ(t).
3. Keep raw data outside this repository or include only minimal,
   derived summary tables when permitted by the original data licenses.

This repository focuses on **structural methodology**, not on data
redistribution.
